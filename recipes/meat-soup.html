    <h3>
        The Soup That Fed the Hoard.
    </h3>

    <p>
            Soup has been around since before dogs were mans 
        best friend. I feel like this dish is a good dish 
        to make unique, add or remove ingredients, make it 
        thick and creamy or thin and light. Your very own
        Viking soup!</p>

     <p>    But the purpose of this article is to give you 
        a recipe that brings the tast as if you were eating 
        in the Great Hall with kin folk and horns of mead. 
        I hope you enjoy this timeless meal and turn it into
        your own secret family recipe!

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     
     <ul>

        <li>8-12 cups water</li>

        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> kg meat (pork, beef, lamb, chicken, ect)</li>

        <li>salt</li>

        <li>3-5 cups of herb such as the top shoots of stinging nettles, young dandelion leaves,
            wild chervil, cress, wild marjorum, dill, plantain, angelica, wild onions, caraway greenery,
            thyme, or whatever the season has to offer. </li>

     </ul>

     <h3>Instructions</h3>
    
     <ol>

        <li>Put the meat in the kettle.</li>

        <li>Pour water over the meat so it is covered and put the kettle on the
            fire. In order that the heat is spread evenly the kettle must be turned about every 5-10
            minutes. </li>

        <li>When the water boils it should cook for about one hour. It may be necessary to add
            more water so the meat is always covered with water</li>

        <li>While the meat is cooking wash and chop the herbs. They will go in the soup when it is ready.
            When the meat is tender take it out and slice it to a size fit for a spoon and return it to the
            soup. Add salt as desired, then it is ready to be served. It can be served with flatbread. </li>
        
        <li>f you want a more filling soup you can add soaked wheat kernels, thick flour... or the soup
            can be smoothed out with pea flour (yellow peas grinded on a stone). </li>
        
     </ol>
