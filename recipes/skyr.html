    <ul>
        <li>6 cups skim milk</li>

        <li> 1 cup buttermilk</li>

        <li> Rennet</li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons sour cream</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>

        <li>Thoroughly sanitize your equipment</li>

        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, bring milk to a slow and 
            steady simmer over a medium-high burner, heating 
            it until it reaches the scalding point (use a 
            thermometer to ensure it reaches 185 F to 190 F). 
            This will take about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir frequently to prevent scalding. If, toward
            the very end of the heating process, you notice
            that the milk at the bottom of the pot has begun 
            to scald, reduce the heat to medium-low and stop 
            stirring. A small bit of scalding is OK, but you 
            don't want to release the scalded bits into the
            mixture.</li>

        <li>Turn burner off immediately when milk reaches 
            scalding point. Remove from burner and allow to
            cool to 110 F.</li>

        <li>In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of cooled milk with 
            skyr, then return mixture to the pot, stirring to 
            incorporate.</li>

        <li>Whisk liquid rennet into warm water, then stir immediately 
            into milk (the rennet will lose its effectiveness if prepared 
            more than 30 minutes before using).</li>
            
        <li>Cover pot with a thick towel and keep in a warm, draft-free 
            place (an oven or an insulated cooler) for 12 hours.</li>    
        
        <li>After the allotted time, curds will have formed. Spoon curds 
            into a fine-meshed bag (nylon vegetable bags work great for 
            this) or a double-layer of cheesecloth.</li>

        <li>Suspend bag over a dripping tray in a cool room or the 
            refrigerator and allow to drain until skyr is thick.</li> 
            
        <li>Serve skyr and enjoy. Skyr will keep for three or four 
            weeks, covered, in the refrigerator</li>
