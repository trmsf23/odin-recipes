    <p>     Mead, to me brings thoughts of horn mugs clanking while Vikings
        cheers in the great hall. It has an almost mystical history surrounded
        by stories of the gods yet shrowded in mystery almost forgotten in time.
        where has the Nectar of the Gods gone?
    </p>
   

    <p>     Well my friend, I'm here to bring back some of that old
        traditional passtime of drinking mead and getting jolly. But 
        I just want to throw a modern twist on it to make it a perfect
        drink for anyone who wants to taste what Odin drinks.
