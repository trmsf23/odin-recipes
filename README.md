My First htlm Project

Hello People! This is my first go at creating a simple HTML webpage. I'm displaying what I've learned so far, showing I know the basics of HTML tags, elements, boilerplates, links, and images. using good Git commit practices and organizational skills. I am excited to learn and see the results. Later, I will be adding CSS to my recipes, but for now, we're keeping it in HTML! I hope you enjoy the recipes.
